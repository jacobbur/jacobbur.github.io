# Introduction 
Hello, my name is Jacob Burchett. I am a student pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a software engineering concentration at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). This GitHub Pages directory serves as my first professional portfolio as well as my final project for CS-499: Computer Science Capstone course. Looking back at my time at SNHU, it has taken a couple of years to reach the endpoint that I am currently at. However, it never seemed like that. Classes seemed to fly by as I continued to learn, each course adding to my skill set. Going into this degree plan without prior software engineering experience, I always felt like I was at a disadvantage. While I definitely made mistakes along the way, I pushed harder because of this and made sure that I absorbed everything I could from each course. 

# What You'll Find
Throughout this page, you will find work that had been submitted in a previous course as well as various modifications to the work. The initial submission is from CS-360: Mobile Architecture. The artifact was developed as the final project for CS-360 and is an inventory management application. Though, the final iteration was lost due to a storage drive issue, an earlier iteration was used to update work. I selected this piece of work largely because it met all of the criteria for modifications in the required areas: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

# First Enhancement - Software Design and Engineering
When I began approaching ways to enhance the artifact, I knew I wanted to focus more on usability. The initial design was inconsistent and, due to placement, could be difficult to navigate. The first step was going to be to clean up the application to promote useability for potential users and make it more appealing to look at. To do this, I started by cleaning up the coloring throughout the application. This included making sure all pages were in dark mode to reduce any potential eye strain as well as ensuring that anything with colored text or background followed the same pattern and coloration for consistency. With studies suggesting that consistency improves the user experience by allowing for a sense of familiarity and predictability, I wanted to ensure I incorporated this into the application.

# Second Enhancement - Algorithms and Data Structures
Within the artifact to be enhanced, there were a multitude of errors. The applications had issues from unused code and lack of commenting to comply with industry best practices, to lines of code that were intended for use that were not properly implemented. With that in mind, my time for the second enhancement was focused on cleaning up the code for the application. Initially, there was a screen that users would find when opening the application. This page prompted users to use SMS notifications to assist with tracking inventory. Actual SMS use was never implemented into the application, leaving a screen as well as a class for SMS notifications that served no purpose. As such, the first step to improving the code was to remove those sections. Next, I removed additional sections of unused code, cleaned up the formatting, utilized the necessary code that was written but never set in place, and added comments.

# Third Enhancement - Databases
In the artifact, a simple NoSQL database was used to manage usernames and passwords. With the third enhancement, a second SQLite database was used to manage the inventory table and the database for usernames and passwords was cleaned up to improve functionality.
