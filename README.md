# Introduction 
Hello, my name is Jacob Burchett. I am student pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a software engineering concentration as Southern New Hampshire University. This GitHub Pages directory serves as my first professional portfolio as well as my final project for CS-499: Computer Science Capstone course.

# What You'll Find
Throughout this page, you will find work that had been submitted in a previous course as well as various modifications to the work. The initial submission is from CS-360: Mobile Architecture. The artifact was developed as the final project for CS-360 and is an inventory management application. Though, the final iteration was lost due to a storage drive issue, an earlier iteration was used for the purposes of updating work. I selected this piece of work largely due to the fact that it met all of the criteria for modifications in the required areas: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.
